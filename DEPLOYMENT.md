## Important Notes üìù

### Environment Variables Needed:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_studio_api_key
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend-domain.com
PORT=5000
```

### Camera Requirements:
- **HTTPS is required** for camera access on mobile
- All deployment platforms provide HTTPS automatically
- Works on localhost for development

### Mobile Optimization:
- Game is designed mobile-first
- Camera works on iOS Safari, Android Chrome
- PWA-ready (can be "installed" to home screen)

### Testing Your Deployment:
1. Open the deployed URL on your phone
2. Create a room with difficulty setting
3. Start game and test camera capture
4. Verify AI image validation works
5. Complete a full game to test results page

## Troubleshooting üîß

**Camera not working?**
- Ensure HTTPS is enabled (automatic on deployment platforms)
- Grant camera permissions when prompted
- Try different browsers if issues persist

**AI not working?**
- Check GEMINI_API_KEY is set correctly
- Verify API key has proper permissions
- Game falls back to random validation if AI fails

**Connection issues?**
- Check CORS_ORIGIN matches your frontend domain
- Ensure Socket.IO can connect (check browser console)

## Share Your Game! üéÆ

Once deployed, share your URL:
- `https://your-app-name.railway.app` (Railway)
- `https://your-app-name.vercel.app` (Vercel)
- `https://your-app-name.onrender.com` (Render)

Players can bookmark it, add to home screen, and play together from anywhere!
