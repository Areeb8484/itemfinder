// This file defines the photo prompts used by the game. Prompts are split
// into three difficulty categories: easy, medium and hard. Each list
// contains at least 50 unique entries so that games can run with enough
// variety even after multiple rounds. If you wish to customise the
// prompts you can add or remove items here.
